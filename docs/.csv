More notes:
  - The student has provided annotations for Camera (but the annotations do not necessarily match camera_type_1, because camera_type_1 could be incorrect or missing). Also, the
  student may have done the annotation for the camera incorrectly and wants to correct his own notes.
  - Same for API, also, the way he spelled the API name can be different from the sample name in the dataset, we should give him the option to change either one
  - The student is providing Lighting conditions with the options: lightbox, benchtop, benchtop dark. But the student may have done the annotation for the lighting incorrectly and wants to correct his own notes.
  - The student is providing black/white background with the options: black, white. But the student may have done the annotation for the background incorrectly and wants to correct his own notes.
  - The student is providing mg concentration (w/w mg/mg or w/v mg/mL) and that field values are float numbers that can have decimal places (e.g. 1.23, `1.067, 26.22941176, 0.8416982064 and each row can have unit option like with the options: mg/mg  or  mg/mL. But the student may have done the annotation for the concentration or units incorrectly and wants to correct his own notes.
  - The student is providing `% Conc` and that field values are float numbers that can have decimal places. But the student may have done the annotation for the concentration incorrectly and wants to correct his own notes.


   Also I want to give more info that you should use in the interface. in the dataset csv there a field `url` that points to the image of the PAD, that image is crucial so the student can verify the
  annotated information and the dataset information too.

  using the pad-analytics package we can acess other fields that may potentially show the user that are not in the dataset csv (actually i got the dataset csv using this package)



  The goal was just interact with other ones trying to solve similar tasks but diferent ways so we can learn from each other and potentially collaborate with them.



  > i like better this layout.
  I have a sugestion about the orther. Now you are foucusing the annotation in the left and dataset options in the right.
  Maybe we can do another version that can have the dataset in the left and the possible annotaion in the right. For exam
